 This library will add tracking to observable Knockout.js objects and update their internal state based on whether they have changed. It also provides helper functions for filtering out only the objects that have changed from observableCollections.                 This is useful when working with serialized server objects on the client side, or when you only want to send updated objects back to the server.
